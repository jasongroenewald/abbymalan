						<p>I’m in full swing with being a parent…my daughters are 5 and 7 years old. There are days when it’s wonderful and there are days when it all feels quite overwhelming. Since my work is focused on development, growth and new steps, I am musing about how parenting for me has been a practice in so many ways of my next step, my next growth and the <span class='highlight'>source of my greatest fulfillment</span>.</p>
<p>As a mother I have had little time for meditation retreats, long walks of contemplation and extended moments of silence. Not having this led me to question if I have been growing as a spiritual human being? It sure feels like every ounce of me has grown, has changed, has expanded and evolved in these past 7 years plus the 9 months of my first pregnancy. And so what has that looked like? Felt like? How do I put those shapes, colors and feelings to words? I also began considering how my path as a parent has perhaps been my own spiritual path and that along the way there have been countless practices leading me to where I am right now.</p>
<p>Parenting is a spiritual experience of being in service to another human being.<br />
It is about serving with love and compassion.<br />
It is a practice in loosening the grip of your ego.<br />
It is about opening and growing your heart.<br />
It is a continual practice in patience.<br />
It is about absolute commitment.<br />
It is about something much larger than any of us, no matter what age or life stage we’re at.<br />
It is a practice of being totally in the moment.<br />
It is a practice in slowing down.<br />
It is a practice in being playful and childish.<br />
It is a practice in giving of yourself.<br />
It is a practice in doing the simple things in life; the mundane for some of us.<br />
It is a practice in femininity.<br />
It is a practice in containing and managing one’s anger – anger at all the losses felt as one becomes a parent. The losses are huge; but the gains are huge too. It is a practice in seeing that, acknowledging that and living with that.<br />
It is a practice in coming to terms with exhaustion, ageing, a changing body (for both men and women), loss of energy, and changes in sexual energy and interest.<br />
It is a practice in staying in rather than running away. Yes, there have been lots of times where I just wanted to escape from it all.<br />
It is a practice in seeing your partner/your spouse in a totally different way.<br />
It is a practice in love and contempt.<br />
It is a practice in attachment and non-attachment to all the things you knew and were and could do before your child arrived.<br />
It is a practice in moving ourselves out of the way to make room for another human being.<br />
It is a practice in seeing how similar we are to other parents and what we all go through in raising our children.<br />
It is a practice in growing a community of support.<br />
It is a practice in easing up on our expectations; of the kind of baby we’ll have, of the kind of mother or father we’ll be, of what we’ll be able to achieve in a day/week/month…<br />
It is a practice in deepening and widening our capacity for love, tolerance, patience, understanding and wisdom.<br />
It is a practice in enlarging your heart…to depths and widths you never imagined you could go.<br />
It is a practice in faith. It is a practice in believing in something so much larger, so much bigger than each of us.<br />
It is a practice in laughter, joy, and hilariousness. It is the deepest and most fulfilling source of joy I have ever known.<br />
It is a practice in turning your life upside down and then seeing how well you keep your feet on the ground. Good luck!<br />
It is a practice in living with uncertainty, unpredictability, and constant change.<br />
It is a practice in letting go.<br />
It is a practice in forgiveness and in unconditional love.<br />
It is a practice in seeing the bigger picture; that’s sometimes the only thing that keeps you going.<br />
It is a practice in coming face to face with our deepest fears and our deepest and rawest vulnerabilities. It is a practice in facing the most difficult moments we’ll ever face.<br />
It is a daily practice in decision-making, flexibility, quick responses, new moves and adaptation.<br />
It is a practice in being the “you” that you most fully want to be…as your child gets to know you it’s as if you have a chance to start fresh.<br />
It is a practice in heart opening, in the deepest and fullest love you might ever feel.</p>
<p>And so the list could continue…and it will with the years to come as my daughters grow into teenagers and then young adults. If I asked my mom today she could probably add much more to this list as she continues in every imaginable way to be a mother to me. And so with this I offer to myself to stop questioning whether I have been growing or developing spiritually over all these years. I give myself permission to stop worrying about that and to know and trust that all of me is a culmination of so much learning, the wisdom that comes from experience and a deeply felt life of love and love of life.</p>
<p>I hope that you will also consider giving yourself permission to relax and enjoy who and what you are already, today, right now.</p>
